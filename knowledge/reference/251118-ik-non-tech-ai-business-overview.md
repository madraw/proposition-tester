## 5. GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY & CURRENT STATUS

### Current Marketing Funnel (As of Nov 2025)

**Lead Generation:**
- Primarily paid channels (LinkedIn, Meta)
- CPL: $50-200 per webinar attendee
- Challenge: Targeting misalignment (getting people who ask "What is an LLM?")
- Lead mix quality dropped from 70% to 60% relevant

**Conversion Funnel:**
- Masterclass-type events (moved to single funnel approach)
- WA reminders added to boost attendance
- Average masterclass attendance: ~25 people
- Challenge: Low lead connect rate (~5.5%)

**Sales Process:**
- Small PA (sales) team
- Training program initiated for new PAs
- DSR (Daily Sales Report) standardization implemented
- Focus on G-meet bookings over phone calls

### Strategic GTM Pivot (Ryan's Recommendation - Nov 18, 2025)

**Stop Current Ineffective Activities:**
- Webinars not converting → pause and rethink
- Focus on testing propositions, not sales optimization

**New Testing Framework:**
1. **Top-down testing with landing pages**
   - Create 5 different value propositions
   - Each ad → dedicated landing page for that proposition
   - Success metric: Click-through rate (CTR)
   - Target: 5-20% registration rate from landing page visitors
   - Iterative: Test 5 → eliminate 2 worst → add 2 new → repeat

2. **Test pricing and format simultaneously**
   - Use multivariate testing tools
   - Test proposition + delivery format + price point
   - Different combinations across multiple landing pages

3. **Self-contained operation**
   - Remove dependencies on main product team
   - Buy separate domains for testing
   - Hire junior person/freelancer for admin tasks
   - Madan to handle full funnel initially: ads → landing pages → follow-up
   - Weekly testing sprints with regular review

4. **Alternative approach: 1-on-1 calls**
   - Block calendar for customer conversations (5 hours daily was Ryan's model)
   - Landing page → immediate calendar booking
   - 4/5 show rate typical
   - Learn messaging that works, then scale to webinars and ads

**Key Philosophy:**
- "Don't know what to sell yet" - figure out proposition first
- Product-market fit > sales training
- If product valuable, sales conversion happens naturally after webinar
- Growth testing methodology, not sales process optimization

### Learnings from Past Experiments

**Masterclass Funnel (Sporadic):**
- **Pros**: Topical content attracts users at low CPL, no risk to existing business
- **Cons**: Tactical focus, one-time use assets, leads deprioritized, no continuity/learning
- **Key insight**: Good for experimentation, not real business impact
- **Critical finding**: -50 to -60 correlation between masterclass leads and main funnel conversion (cannibalization)

**Main AI Business Challenges:**
- High CPL ($219-$364) for niche audience
- Low conversion (CAC: $5,800-$7,000)
- Sales-led model won't scale for non-tech/Caucasian audience
- Accent, trust, and race factors affect Indian sales team effectiveness
- High sales team churn: 5-6 hires needed to find 1 who stays 6+ months

---

## 6. BUSINESS CONTEXT & CONSTRAINTS

### Parent Company Context (InterviewKickstart)

**Main Business:**
- Technical interview preparation for FAANG/tech companies
- 10+ years in market
- $6,500 ASP for main program
- Successfully scaled from $1-2k courses to $6.5k over several years
- Growth: $850k → $2M (2.5x) in AI business segment

**Key Business Metrics (Main AI Business):**
- Two main funnels: IP Funnel and SU Funnel
- IP Funnel: $364k spend, $219 CPL, $7k CAC, $6,235 ASP, 0.87 RoAS
- SU Funnel: $290k spend, $160 CPL, $5,800 CAC, $7,860 ASP, 1.35 RoAS

**3 Pillars of Growth (Must work together):**
1. Sales
2. Leads
3. Courses

### Why Non-Tech Business is Strategic

**Leadership Belief:**
- "Non-tech will eventually be bigger than main business" (Burhan)
- Opportunity to learn selling to Caucasian audience (vs. 60% South Asian in tech)
- Build from first principles rather than modify existing business

**Key Constraints:**
- Cannot cannibalize existing business
- Need separate funnel, team, website, sales process
- Long-term: May need Philippines/South Africa sales teams (accent/timezone)
- Current: Focus on PLG or low-touch models

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**
- Maven: High-quality instructors, cohort-based learning
- Reforge: Product/growth focus, recently acquired/struggling
- Deep Learning AI: Technical focus
- GL, Simply Learn: Sell university degrees (different model)

**Key Differentiator:**
- All competitors target technical audience
- Non-tech/no-code AI positioning is open opportunity
- Quality challenge: Competitor instructors have strong social followings

**Competitive Intelligence:**
- 90% of competitor learners get employer reimbursement
- May need to enable reimbursement templates/support
- Potentially rename from "InterviewKickstart" to "IK" or "IKAN" for corporate appeal

## 7. CURRICULUM & INSTRUCTOR STRATEGY

### Content Development Status

**Current State:**
- Week 1-2 lesson plans ready, content in progress
- Week 3 curriculum in development
- Pre-class material with videos live on Uplevel platform
- Focus: Intro to agentic AI solving simple marketing problems (not complex use cases)

**Key Learnings:**
- Participant level lower than expected (most don't know what LLM is, haven't tried Claude)
- Most attendees from EST timezone (80:20 ratio EST:PST)
- Hybrid approach (combo of formats) gave better enrollment results
- Repeat of same agenda improves delivery quality

### Instructor Hiring & Quality

**Current Metrics (Week 27):**
- US Side: 7/20 target achieved, 74 interested, 7 onboarded
- India Side: 2/10 target achieved, 109 interested, 2 onboarded

**Quality Challenges:**
- Instructor profile significantly affects engagement and outcomes
- IK instructor pool quality/popularity lower than Maven, Reforge, Deep Learning AI
- Need "celebrity SMEs" for masterclass credibility

**New Hiring Strategy (Aligned with Soham, Jerin, Recruitment):**
1. Expand sourcing beyond FAANG+ to professionals actively using AI with real outcomes
2. Compensate demo preparation (up to 3 hours @ $100/hr) to reduce drop-offs
3. Pay rate based on demo quality and expectations (discussed post-demo, not upfront)
4. Hire instructors with strong social followings (for viral/word-of-mouth)
5. Consider revenue share with influential instructors

**Credibility Strategy:**
- Mix of practitioners + strategists needed
- Visual credibility: More logos = better perception
- Balance teaching ability vs. sales appeal
- Focus on applied learning, not just theory

---

## 8. PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY & LEARNINGS

### Community-First Approach (Ryan's Framework)

**Build for "Mavens":**
- Target momentum audience: upwardly mobile, driven, high-agency
- They want live instruction (not video)
- Willing to pay premium for intensity
- Natural word-of-mouth amplifiers
- Think: "who are the micro-influencers?"

**Engineering Word-of-Mouth:**
1. Selection as quality filter (entrance requirements)
   - Creates exclusivity and better outcomes
   - Examples: ISB (1-year program, foreign faculty), Howard (great students)
   - Higher conversion rates from selectivity
   - Natural network effects from cohort quality

2. Day-1 value and continuous wow moments
   - First class must deliver immediate applicable value
   - Applied learning throughout (not theory-heavy start)
   - Variable rewards keep students engaged

3. Strong instructor network with social presence
   - Instructors should post about program
   - Revenue sharing for amplification
   - Build credibility through instructor brands

**Key Insight:**
- "If product valuable, sales guy is completely irrelevant" (Ryan)
- Focus on making customers promote you vs. doing hard work of promotion
- Build something small cohorts love → word-of-mouth → scale

### Positioning Learnings

**Major Barrier to Overcome:**
- Everyone thinks they need to code for AI
- Real example: VC investor (Prishab from Marico family) interested but blocked by coding misconception
- Ryan's wife (Cambridge grad, university topper) - mental block despite being "super bright"
- Barrier takes 6 months to cross mentally, but building first agent takes 5 minutes

**Solution:**
- "Become an AI builder without knowing how to code"
- "No-code AI" positioning
- Remove fear, show it's accessible

## 9. HISTORICAL CONTEXT & CRITICAL LEARNINGS

### AI Business Journey (2023-2025)

**2022-2023 Context:**
- Main business facing headwinds post-2021 euphoria
- Layoffs occurred in company
- AI course launched 2023, initially sold to alumni

**Advanced ML Program:**
- 14-16 month course covering SQL → Python → ML → NLP → MLOps
- High price ($7k), low conversion (2-3%)
- Cost structure: 35% operational, 65% sales/marketing

**Growth Drivers (to $2M):**
1. Lead growth through paid marketing scale-up
2. Alumni channel growth from $250k to $500k baseline

**Major Operational Cleanup (Oct-Dec 2024):**
- Sales team restructuring: Removed underperforming legacy team
- Hired David (trusted connection) to rebuild organization
- Strategy: New managers for old staff, old managers for new staff
- Result: Poor performers left, ineffective managers couldn't develop talent
- Marketing budget reduced $400k → $270k during optimization
- RoAS improved to 1.8+ during efficiency period
- May 2025: Started scaling back to $400k+ budget

### Critical Mistake: SkillUp Launch (April 2024)

**What Happened:**
- Launched $4k ASP course in main funnel (main funnel ASP was $8k)
- ASP + Revenue got hit badly
- Lesson: Mixing low ASP course in high ASP funnel = disaster

**Correct Approach: Agent AI Launch (March 2025):**
- Created completely separate parallel funnel
- New ads, new landing pages, new webinar, new team
- Avoided cannibalization risk
- Success because it was isolated

**Key Philosophy:**
- "Once you know the risk, it's easier to manage" (Burhan)
- Initiative owners lack full business view to assess impact
- Business head must view combined metrics, not individual channels
- Any new initiative can negatively impact existing business
- Sequential betting > simultaneous multiple initiatives

### Masterclass Cannibalization Issue

**Pattern Observed:**
- Masterclasses successful for reactivation, poor for new acquisition
- When masterclass ads run parallel to webinar ads on Meta/Facebook
- Leads get randomly distributed between funnels
- Masterclass designed for engagement, not conversion
- Result: Main business revenue drops
- Negative correlation: -50 to -60 between masterclass leads % and main funnel conversion

**Response:**
- Shut down masterclasses multiple times (May, August, October 2025)
- Lesson: "If you up one parameter and overall revenue goes down, something is off"
- Marketing team incentivized to show new initiatives, not protect overall revenue

## 10. THREE WORK STREAMS (Madan's Focus Areas)

### Priority Order:
1. **Curriculum**: Stabilize course content and experience
2. **Sales**: Get basic processes and training right
3. **Leads**: Tackle after above two are stabilized

### Current Status:

**Curriculum:**
- Working with Kalindi (curriculum team) 3x per week
- Deadline-driven mode (not optimization mode yet)
- Philosophy: "Curriculum will improve over time, can't happen immediately"
- Better to have imperfect product people buy than perfect product no one buys
- First batch validation → then improve experience

**Sales:**
- PA training program launched
- DSR format standardization implemented
- Team expansion: Added 2 PAs, planned 5 more junior PAs
- Challenge: Initial pitch too interview-like, building rapport difficult
- WhatsApp integration pending (Meta approval for templates)
- LinkedIn profiling of leads to give PAs context/cue cards

**Leads:**
- Moved completely to Masterclass-type funnel for efficiency
- Fixed broken landing page submit button
- LinkedIn campaigns: ₹34 CPL vs Google Discovery ₹109 CPL
- Enhanced email sequences: 3rd email (3 hrs before), SMS (1 hr before + 15 min after)
- Developing alternate low-touch WhatsApp flow for qualification/engagement

### Pilots in Development:
- WhatsApp chatbot for registered leads (better profiling and intent evaluation)
- Caucasian PA to improve webinar attendance

---

## 13. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

**Must Get Right:**
1. Value proposition that removes "need to code" barrier
2. Entrance criteria that attract high-quality, high-word-of-mouth students
3. Day-1 value that creates immediate wow moments
4. Testing framework that finds product-market fit before scaling sales
5. Avoid cannibalization of any existing business

**Avoid:**
1. Scaling sales before knowing what sells
2. Mixing low ASP with high ASP in same funnel
3. Running multiple experiments that cannibalize each other
4. Depending on main product/tech team for iterations
5. Generic positioning that competes with established players

**Key Philosophy:**
- "Go slow to go fast" - validate with small cohorts first
- Focus on word-of-mouth engineering, not paid ads at scale
- Build something customers love → let them promote it
- Product-market fit > sales optimization
- Once you know the risk, it's easier to manage
