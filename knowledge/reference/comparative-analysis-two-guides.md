## Key Decisions for Final Document

### 1. Tone & Approach
**Option A:** Teaching-focused like Billboard (more exercises, explanations)
**Option B:** Reference-focused like Digital (quick lookup, templates)
**Recommendation:** Hybrid - teaching sections for principles, reference sections for execution

### 2. Example Strategy
**Current:** Digital has real examples, Billboard has fictional
**Recommendation:** Use real examples for platform-specific, generic examples for principles (so they transfer across brands)

### 3. Depth vs Breadth
**Current:** Billboard goes deep on one thing, Digital goes wide
**Recommendation:** Deep on principles, wide on applications - teach the thinking, show the variations

### 4. LLM Optimization
**Current:** Digital is structured for LLM, Billboard is not
**Recommendation:** Format all sections for both human learning AND LLM instruction parsing

### 5. Length Management
**Current:** Both docs are ~8-12K words each
**Challenge:** Unified doc could be 25-30K words
**Recommendation:** Modular structure - core principles + pluggable modules by use case

## What Success Looks Like

**The final unified document should enable Claude Code to:**

1. **Generate short-form ads** that pass the Billboard Guide quality rubric while respecting Digital Playbook platform constraints

2. **Write landing page copy** with structure, persuasion, and optimization (currently missing from both)

3. **Direct visual content** with clear art direction that partners with copy (weak in both)

4. **Adapt across funnel stages** from awareness to conversion with appropriate tone and structure

5. **Self-assess quality** using rubrics and checklists, not just generate and hope

6. **Learn from examples** through before/after transformations that teach the thinking

7. **Execute across platforms** with technical precision and psychological awareness

8. **Maintain standards** that match top-tier agency work, not just "good enough"

9. **Troubleshoot problems** systematically when copy isn't working

10. **Scale efficiently** through frameworks while maintaining quality through principles

## Questions for Alignment

Before creating the final document, let's align on:

1. **Primary use case priority:**
   - Short-form ads (LinkedIn, Meta, Google)?
   - Landing pages?
   - Both equally?
   - Add email/content?

2. **Depth vs speed trade-off:**
   - Prioritize teaching (more exercises, longer)?
   - Prioritize generation speed (more templates, quicker)?
   - Balanced hybrid?

3. **Industry focus:**
   - SaaS/B2B priority (your context)?
   - Multi-industry coverage?
   - Generic + pluggable industry modules?

4. **Length target:**
   - Comprehensive (25-30K words)?
   - Concise (15K words)?
   - Modular (core + separate modules)?

5. **Visual content:**
   - How deep into art direction?
   - Video script structure depth?
   - Just guidelines or full frameworks?

6. **Testing & optimization:**
   - How much space for A/B testing strategy?
   - Include measurement frameworks?
   - Focus on copy quality or full campaign optimization?

## Immediate Next Steps

**After your feedback:**

1. Agree on structure outline
2. Agree on priorities (ads vs landing pages vs both)
3. Agree on depth/length target
4. I'll create the unified best practices document
5. You review and we iterate
6. Final version ready for Claude Code deployment

**What I need from you:**

- Which strengths from each doc resonate most with your needs?
- What gaps are most critical to fill?
- Any specific use cases for InterviewKickstart AI courses that should be prioritized?
- Preferences on tone (teaching vs reference)?
- Target length or modular structure preference?
