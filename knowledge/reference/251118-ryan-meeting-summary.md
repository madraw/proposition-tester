## Main Discussion Points

### 1. Current Situation Assessment
- Webinars are not driving sales - the proposition is not landing
- Have 6 students for Nov 22 cohort (low numbers)
- Problem: Don't know what the market actually wants to buy

### 2. Core Issue: Product-Market Fit Over Sales Process
- Sales training won't help if the product/proposition isn't valuable
- Need to first figure out WHAT can sell, then optimize HOW to sell it
- If product is valuable, conversion happens naturally

### 3. Recommended Testing Approach: Top-Down (Landing Pages)
- Create 5 different value propositions targeting the same course content
- Each ad leads to detailed landing page for that specific proposition
- Example propositions:
  - "Transform your career by getting AI enabled"
  - "Build skills to get a better job"
  - "Building with AI is hard - accelerate your journey"
  - "Become an AI builder without knowing how to code" ⭐
  - "Lead with AI without knowing how to code"
- Success metric: Click-through rate (CTR)
- Target: 5-20% registration rate from landing page visitors
- Iterative: Test 5 → eliminate 2 worst → add 2 new → repeat

### 4. Major Market Barrier Identified
- **Everyone thinks they need to code for AI** (this is THE barrier)
- Real example: Prishab (VC from Marico family) - interested but blocked by this misconception
- Positioning opportunity: "No-code AI" for non-tech professionals
- All competitors focus on tech audience - clear differentiation

### 5. Course Structure Validation
- Current 6-week structure is sound
- Could adapt to: 4 weeks core + 2 weeks specialization
  - Core: GPT mastery, tools, agents basics
  - Specializations: HR, marketing, sales, finance use cases

### 6. Pricing & Format Testing
- Move from "course" to "accelerator" model
- Pricing: $999-$1,999 (test multiple price points)
- Delivery formats to test:
  - Full-time: 3-4 days, 6-8 hours/day (18-24 total hours)
  - Part-time: 6 days or 2 weekends
  - Semi part-time: over one month
- Hypothesis: People prefer quick, intensive learning over long courses
- Use multivariate testing for proposition + format + price combinations

### 7. Operational Requirements
- Remove dependencies on product team (Swami)
- Buy separate domains for testing (don't wait for subdomains)
- Hire junior person/freelancer for admin tasks
- Madan to handle full funnel initially: ads → landing pages → follow-up
- Weekly testing sprints with regular reviews
- Need dedicated paid marketing person

## Next Actions

1. **STOP** current ineffective activities (webinars that don't convert)
2. **Madan to create comprehensive testing plan** before next meeting
3. **Set up 3x per week check-ins** - every other day, 30 minutes each
4. **Focus on growth testing methodology** rather than sales process optimization
5. **Build self-contained testing operation** - no dependencies on product team
6. **Buy domains** and set up testing infrastructure
7. **Hire** junior person/freelancer for admin support

## Key Quote
> "We should step back. Instead of trying to sell something that is not getting traction, we need to first figure out what can sell."

## Strategic Shift
**From:** Optimizing sales process for existing proposition
**To:** Testing multiple propositions to find product-market fit

## Key Insights from Transcript

### Webinar Energy Transfer
- Webinars are about energy transfer from speaker to listener
- People need to be evangelized to take action
- Energy dissipates exponentially after webinar - need immediate conversion

### Testing Framework: Two Approaches
1. **Bottom-up:** One-on-one conversations → find what works → scale to webinars → ads
2. **Top-down:** Multiple ad/landing page tests simultaneously with small budgets (RECOMMENDED)

### The Coding Barrier
- Even smart, successful people (VCs, Cambridge graduates) have mental block
- They think coding is required for AI
- This is the single biggest barrier to address
- Messaging must explicitly state: "No coding required"

### Multivariate Testing
- Can test multiple variables simultaneously:
  - Proposition (5+ variations)
  - Delivery format (full-time/part-time/semi-part-time)
  - Price points ($999/$1,499/$1,999)
- Build branching tree for comprehensive testing
- Budget allows faster answers

### Course vs Accelerator Model
- Shift from long courses to intensive accelerators
- People want to learn quick, apply immediately, and deliver results
- Modern attention spans don't support 6-month commitments
- 3-4 day intensive > 6-week spread out

## Meeting Cadence
- 3x per week check-ins
- Every other day
- 30 minutes each
- Weekly testing sprint reviews
