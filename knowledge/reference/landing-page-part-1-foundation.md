# Landing Page Copywriting - Part 1: Foundation & Theory

**For LLM Reference: Conversion-focused long-form copy principles and architecture**

---

## Document Purpose & Usage

This document contains the **foundational principles, psychology, and architecture** for high-converting landing pages.

**When to use this document:**
- Creating landing pages from scratch
- Optimizing existing landing pages
- Understanding full-page persuasion flow
- Building landing page templates

**What this document does NOT contain:**
- Short-form ad copy (see Digital Creative docs)
- Templates and examples (see Landing Page Part 2)
- Platform-specific tactics (see Digital Creative docs)

**Prerequisites:**
Read Timeless Principles Part 1 first for foundational copywriting principles.

**Core Philosophy:**
> "A landing page is a sales conversation in written form. Every section has a job. Every word must earn its keep. Guide the reader from curiosity to conviction to conversion."

---

## Part 1: Landing Page Fundamentals

### 1.1 What Makes Landing Pages Different

**Landing Page vs Other Copy:**

| Aspect | Short-Form Ads | Landing Pages |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Goal** | Get click/attention | Get conversion/commitment |
| **Length** | 3-70 words | 500-3,000+ words |
| **Structure** | Single message | Multi-section journey |
| **Persuasion** | Single promise | Layered argument |
| **Objections** | Ignore (not enough space) | Address systematically |
| **Proof** | Minimal | Extensive (testimonials, case studies) |
| **Reader State** | Distracted, scanning | Interested, evaluating |

**Key Insight:**
Landing pages are for readers who are ALREADY interested (they clicked). Your job is not to get attention—it's to build conviction and remove friction.

### 1.2 The Three Conversion Barriers

Every landing page must overcome three barriers:

**Barrier 1: Relevance ("Is this for me?")**
- Answered in: Hero section (first 5 seconds)
- How: Clear headline matching ad/source
- Test: Can visitor self-identify immediately?

**Barrier 2: Credibility ("Can I trust this?")**
- Answered in: Social proof, trust signals throughout
- How: Testimonials, logos, stats, guarantees
- Test: Would I trust this if I didn't know the brand?

**Barrier 3: Friction ("Is this worth the effort?")**
- Answered in: Clear value prop, simple process, risk reversal
- How: Simple forms, clear next steps, guarantees
- Test: Is the ask proportional to the value shown?

**Your landing page structure must address all three barriers in order.**

### 1.3 The Conversion Hierarchy

```
HIERARCHY (Top to Bottom):

1. ATTENTION (Hero)
   └─ Job: Stop scroll, establish relevance

2. INTEREST (Benefits/Transformation)
   └─ Job: Show what's possible, create desire

3. DESIRE (Social Proof/Details)
   └─ Job: Make it believable, build conviction

4. CONVICTION (Objection Handling)
   └─ Job: Remove doubts, address concerns

5. ACTION (CTA/Form)
   └─ Job: Make next step obvious and easy
```

**Critical Rule:**
You cannot skip steps. A visitor must move through each stage. Trying to get action before building desire = low conversion.

---

## Part 2: Page Architecture & Flow

### 2.1 The Standard Landing Page Structure

**Section Order (with purpose):**

```
1. HERO SECTION
   Purpose: Establish relevance, state promise
   Reader Question: "Is this for me?"
   Goal: 5-second clarity

2. SOCIAL PROOF STRIP (Optional but recommended)
   Purpose: Immediate credibility
   Reader Question: "Who else uses this?"
   Goal: Logos or stat that builds trust

3. PROBLEM/AGITATION (Optional, for problem-aware audiences)
   Purpose: Establish shared pain point
   Reader Question: "Do they understand my struggle?"
   Goal: Empathy and relevance

4. TRANSFORMATION/OUTCOME
   Purpose: Show the end state, create desire
   Reader Question: "What will my life look like?"
   Goal: Emotional pull toward future state

5. HOW IT WORKS / PROCESS
   Purpose: Remove mystery, show path
   Reader Question: "How do I get there?"
   Goal: Simplicity and clarity

6. FEATURES/BENEFITS
   Purpose: Provide detail for evaluators
   Reader Question: "What exactly do I get?"
   Goal: Comprehensive value understanding

7. SOCIAL PROOF (Detailed)
   Purpose: Build credibility and conviction
   Reader Question: "Has this worked for others like me?"
   Goal: Trust through peer success

8. OBJECTION HANDLING / FAQ
   Purpose: Remove remaining doubts
   Reader Question: "What about [concern]?"
   Goal: Address every possible hesitation

9. PRICING (If applicable)
   Purpose: Clear value exchange
   Reader Question: "What does it cost and what's included?"
   Goal: Transparent, justified pricing

10. FINAL CTA / GUARANTEE
    Purpose: Make commitment easy and risk-free
    Reader Question: "What happens if I say yes?"
    Goal: Conversion with confidence
```

**Flexible Structure Note:**
Not every page needs every section. Adjust based on:
- Audience awareness level (cold vs warm)
- Product complexity (simple vs complex)
- Price point (low vs high)
- Sales cycle (quick vs long)

### 2.2 Above vs Below the Fold

**Above the Fold Philosophy:**

The "fold" is the bottom of the screen before scrolling. In the first screen (above fold), you must answer:
1. What is this?
2. Is it for me?
3. What's the main benefit?

**Above the Fold Must-Haves:**
- Clear headline (benefit or transformation)
- Supporting subheadline
- Primary CTA button
- Trust signal (logo, stat, or social proof)
- Relevant visual (product, outcome, or person)

**What NOT to Put Above Fold:**
- Long paragraphs
- Detailed features
- Multiple CTAs competing
- Navigation menus (debatable—test both)

**Below the Fold Philosophy:**

Below fold is for interested visitors who want more information before deciding. This is where you build the case.

**Below the Fold Should Include:**
- Detailed benefits and features
- Multiple forms of social proof
- Process/how it works
- FAQ/objection handling
- Pricing details (if complex)
- Secondary CTAs (repeat at logical intervals)

**The Scroll Depth Principle:**
Most people who scroll past 50% are serious evaluators. Give them the depth they need.

### 2.3 The Inverted Pyramid Model

```
WIDE (Emotional, Big Promise)
   ↓
MEDIUM (Logical, How It Works)
   ↓
NARROW (Specific, Details & Proof)
   ↓
POINT (Simple, Clear CTA)
```

**How This Works:**

**Top (Hero):** Emotional hook, big transformation promise
- "Build AI agents without coding"
- Speaks to desire and aspiration

**Middle (Explanation):** Logical explanation, process
- "6-week live program with hands-on projects"
- Answers "how" and "what"

**Bottom (Details):** Specific features, proof, objections
- Curriculum details, testimonials, FAQ
- For serious evaluators

**Point (CTA):** Simple, clear action
- "Book Free Strategy Call"
- Remove all friction

---

## Part 3: Section-by-Section Principles

### 3.1 Hero Section Anatomy

**Components:**

**1. Headline (Most Critical Element)**
- Job: Communicate the main promise in 8-15 words
- Test: Could a distracted visitor understand it in 5 seconds?
- Format: [Outcome] + [Qualifier/Speed/Method]

**Headline Types:**

```
A. Direct Benefit:
   "Land Your First AI Job in 90 Days"

B. Transformation:
   "From Marketing Manager to AI Leader in 6 Weeks"

C. Problem-Solution:
   "Build AI Agents Without Learning to Code"

D. Aspirational:
   "Lead AI Projects. Ship AI Products. Transform Your Career."

E. Specific Outcome:
   "Get 2.5 Hours Back Every Day with AI Meeting Notes"
```

**2. Subheadline (Supporting Context)**
- Job: Elaborate on promise, add credibility or specificity
- Length: 15-25 words
- Format: [How] + [For Whom] + [Proof/Differentiator]

**Examples:**
```
Headline: "Land Your First AI Job in 90 Days"
Subheadline: "No CS degree required. Learn from FAANG engineers. Job placement support included."

Headline: "Build AI Agents Without Coding"
Subheadline: "6-week live program for non-technical professionals. Real projects. Real portfolio."
```

**3. Call-to-Action (CTA) Button**
- Job: Make next step obvious
- Label: Action-oriented, benefit-clear
- Format: [Verb] + [Benefit/What They Get]

**CTA Label Examples:**
```
Generic: "Get Started"
Better: "Start Free Trial"
Best: "Book Free Strategy Call"

Generic: "Learn More"
Better: "See How It Works"
Best: "Download 50 AI Prompts"
```

**CTA Button Design Principles:**
- Contrasting color (stands out from page)
- Large enough to see immediately
- Above fold, visible without scrolling
- Repeated below fold at logical intervals

**4. Trust Signal**
- Job: Immediate credibility check
- Placement: Near headline or below CTA
- Format: [Social proof number] or [Logo strip] or [Star rating]

**Examples:**
```
"Trusted by 2,400+ marketing professionals"
"Used by teams at [Google] [Meta] [Amazon]"
"4.9/5 from 1,200+ reviews"
"Join 10,000+ AI builders"
```

**5. Visual/Media**
- Job: Reinforce message, show outcome or product
- Types: Product screenshot, outcome visualization, person (target audience)
- Test: Does visual ADD meaning or just decorate?

**Hero Section Checklist:**
□ Headline states clear benefit (not vague)
□ Subheadline adds context (not repetition)
□ CTA button is visible and action-clear
□ Trust signal present
□ Visual supports message (not generic stock photo)
□ Entire section passes 5-second test

### 3.2 Problem/Agitation Section

**When to Use:**
- Problem-aware audiences (they know their pain)
- Competitive markets (need to establish unique understanding)
- Complex solutions (need to justify why it matters)

**When to Skip:**
- Solution-aware audiences (they know what they need)
- Low-friction purchases (impulse buys)
- Very short sales cycles

**Structure:**

**1. State the Problem (Empathy)**
```
Format: "[Current painful situation]"

Example:
"Spending 5 hours every week taking meeting notes, organizing action items, and following up on deliverables?"
```

**2. Agitate (Make It Worse)**
```
Format: "[Consequences if unsolved]"

Example:
"That's 260 hours per year—an entire month of your life. Meanwhile, critical decisions slip through cracks because you can't remember every detail."
```

**3. Implication (What's at Stake)**
```
Format: "[Bigger cost/opportunity lost]"

Example:
"Every missed action item is a delayed project. Every forgotten detail is a trust issue with your team."
```

**Problem Section Principles:**
- Use "you" language (second person)
- Be specific about the pain
- Don't over-agitate (avoid fear-mongering)
- Transition smoothly to solution

**Example Full Section:**
```
Headline: "Your Team Forgets 40% of Meeting Decisions"

Body:
"It happens in every organization. Someone mentions an important detail in a 60-minute meeting. Everyone nods. Two weeks later, nobody remembers who was supposed to do what.

You're spending hours every week taking notes, organizing action items, and following up. That's an entire month per year just trying to remember what was said.

Meanwhile, projects stall because 'we thought you were handling that.' Trust erodes. Momentum dies.

There's a better way."

[Transition to Solution]
```

### 3.3 Transformation/Outcome Section

**Purpose:**
Show the "after" state. Paint a vivid picture of life with the solution.

**Psychological Principle:**
People buy the feeling of the outcome, not the features of the product. This section sells the dream.

**Structure Options:**

**Option A: Before/After Comparison**
```
BEFORE (Current State) | AFTER (With Solution)
"2 hours of notes"     | "2 minutes. AI handled it."
"Forgotten action items"| "Auto-sent to everyone"
"Searching for details"| "Ask AI, get answer"
```

**Option B: Day-in-the-Life Narrative**
```
"Monday morning. You walk into your team meeting without a notebook.

During the call, you're fully present—asking questions, making eye contact, actually listening—while AI captures every word.

Meeting ends. Within 2 minutes, everyone gets a summary with action items, assigned to the right people, with deadlines.

You leave early. No notes to organize. No follow-ups to write.

That's 2 hours back in your day. Every day."
```

**Option C: Outcome List (Visual-Friendly)**
```
With [Product], you:
✓ Never take notes again
✓ Capture 100% of decisions
✓ Get 5 hours back every week
✓ Never miss an action item
✓ Build perfect meeting memory
```

**Transformation Section Principles:**
- Make it visceral and specific
- Use sensory language (what they see, feel, experience)
- Focus on emotional outcomes (relief, confidence, freedom)
- Connect to bigger life benefits

### 3.4 How It Works / Process Section

**Purpose:**
Remove mystery. Show the path from where they are to where they want to be.

**Psychological Principle:**
Unknown = scary. Known = doable. Simplify the path to make action feel achievable.

**Standard Process Structure:**

```
Step 1: [Simple action]
Brief description (1-2 sentences)

Step 2: [What happens next]
Brief description

Step 3: [Outcome/result]
Brief description
```

**Process Section Best Practices:**

**1. Keep It to 3-5 Steps**
- Fewer = simpler = less intimidating
- More steps = complexity = friction

**2. Use Action-Oriented Language**
```
Weak: "Registration process"
Strong: "Sign up in 2 minutes"

Weak: "Implementation phase"
Strong: "We set everything up for you"
```

**3. Show Time Estimates**
```
Step 1: Sign up (2 minutes)
Step 2: First AI meeting (30 seconds to start)
Step 3: Get summary (instant)
```

**4. Indicate Who Does What**
```
YOU:        "Book a strategy call"
US:         "We assess your needs"
TOGETHER:   "Pick your cohort start date"
AUTOMATED:  "AI handles all meeting notes"
```

**Example Process Sections:**

**Service Example (Consulting):**
```
How We Work Together:

1. Strategy Call (30 minutes)
   We discuss your goals, challenges, and timeline.

2. Custom Proposal (48 hours)
   You get a detailed plan with pricing and deliverables.

3. Kickoff & Execution (Week 1)
   We start immediately. You get weekly updates.

4. Results (90 days)
   Track progress with shared dashboards.
```

**Product Example (SaaS):**
```
Get Started in 3 Steps:

1. Connect your calendar (1 click)
2. Join your first meeting (AI auto-records)
3. Get instant summary (sent to everyone)

That's it. No training. No manual entry.
```

**Course Example (Education):**
```
Your 6-Week Journey:

Week 1-2: Build your first AI agent (no code)
Week 3-4: Deploy automation workflows
Week 5: Specialize (marketing/sales/HR)
Week 6: Portfolio project + career mentoring

Finish with 3 portfolio pieces for interviews.
```

### 3.5 Features & Benefits Section

```

**Social Proof Section Principles:**

**1. Match Proof to Audience**
```
For Startups: Show other startup founders

```

**2. Use Specificity**
```
Weak: "Great product, very helpful"
Strong: "We went from 2-hour meeting recaps to 2-minute AI summaries. Saved our team 15 hours per week."
```

**3. Include Objection-Crushing Proof**

Use Proof: "Setup took 90 seconds. First meeting summary came immediately."

If Objection is: "Won't work for technical discussions"
Use Proof: "We use it for engineering sprint planning. Captures technical details perfectly."
```

**4. Vary Proof Types**
```
Don't just use testimonials. Mix:
- Written testimonials (3-5)
- Video testimonials (1-2)

- Logos (credibility by association)
```

**5. Make Proof Scannable**
```
Use:

## Part 4: Advanced Landing Page Principles

### 4.1 The Awareness Spectrum

**Eugene Schwartz's 5 Awareness Levels:**

Different awareness levels require different landing page approaches.

**Level 1: Unaware**
- Don't know they have a problem
- Landing Page Focus: Education, problem identification
- Example: "Why Your Meetings Are Killing Productivity"

**Level 2: Problem Aware**
- Know the pain, don't know solutions exist
- Landing Page Focus: Problem agitation → introduce solution category
- Example: "Tired of Wasting Hours on Meeting Notes?"

**Level 3: Solution Aware**
- Know solution category exists, comparing options
- Landing Page Focus: Why your solution is best
- Example: "AI Meeting Notes That Actually Work"

**Level 4: Product Aware**
- Know your product, evaluating if it's right for them
- Landing Page Focus: Features, proof, objection handling
- Example: "See Why 10,000 Teams Choose [Product]"

**Level 5: Most Aware**
- Ready to buy, just need final push or right offer
- Landing Page Focus: Offer details, urgency, simple CTA
- Example: "Start Your 14-Day Free Trial Today"

**How This Changes Your Landing Page:**

```
UNAWARE (Level 1-2):
- Longer page (need education)
- Problem-focused hero
- Extensive "why this matters" section
- Social proof comes earlier

SOLUTION AWARE (Level 3):
- Standard page length
- Benefit-focused hero
- Comparison to alternatives
- Feature depth matters

MOST AWARE (Level 4-5):
- Shorter page possible
- Offer-focused hero
- Pricing front and center
- Simple path to purchase
```

### 4.2 The Objection Handling Framework

**Every high-ticket or complex product faces objections. Your page must handle them.**

**Common Objection Categories:**

**1. Credibility Objections**
```
"How do I know this will work?"
Handle with: Social proof, case studies, guarantees

"Why should I trust you?"
Handle with: Credentials, logos, transparent process
```

**2. Complexity Objections**
```
"This seems too complicated"
Handle with: Simple process, quick start times, "done for you" elements

"I don't have time to learn this"
Handle with: Time savings data, automation emphasis
```

**3. Price Objections**
```
"This is expensive"
Handle with: ROI calculation, cost of NOT solving problem, payment plans

"Why not use free alternative?"
Handle with: Comparison, hidden costs of "free"
```

**4. Timing Objections**
```
"Not the right time"
Handle with: Urgency, scarcity, opportunity cost

"I need to think about it"
Handle with: Risk reversal, guarantee, trial period
```

**5. Fit Objections**
```
"Will this work for my situation?"
Handle with: Specific use cases, varied testimonials

"I'm not technical enough"
Handle with: No-code emphasis, support availability
```

**Where to Handle Objections:**

```
THROUGHOUT (Proactive):
- Hero: Address #1 objection in subheadline
- Process: Show simplicity (handles complexity objection)
- Pricing: Show ROI (handles price objection)
- Social Proof: Show diverse use cases (handles fit objection)

FAQ SECTION (Reactive):
- List remaining objections as questions
- Answer directly and completely
- Use proof where possible
```

**FAQ Section Best Practices:**

**1. Address Real Objections (Not Fluff)**
```
Weak: "What makes you different?"
Strong: "Why is this better than using free ChatGPT?"

Weak: "How does it work?"
Strong: "Do I need technical skills to set this up?"
```

**2. Answer Completely**
```
Don't just say "No, it's easy"
Say: "No technical skills needed. Setup takes 90 seconds: connect your calendar, click 'record' in your next meeting, get instant summary. No training required."
```

**3. Use Proof in Answers**
```
Q: "Will this work for engineering teams?"
A: "Yes. Google's product team uses us for sprint planning. Our AI handles technical terminology, code discussions, and architecture decisions. 87% of our users are in technical roles."
```

**4. Order Strategically**
```
Lead with:
1. Most common objection
2. Biggest barrier to purchase
3. Most emotionally charged concern
```

### 4.3 The Scannability Principle

**Reality:** Most visitors SCAN first, read second.

**Scannability Techniques:**

**1. Visual Hierarchy**
```
Use:
- Headlines (large, bold)
- Subheadlines (medium, clear)
- Body (readable size, good line height)
- Whitespace (breathing room)
```

**2. Formatting for Scanning**
```
✓ Bullet points (easy to scan)
✓ Bold key phrases
✓ Short paragraphs (2-4 lines max)
✓ Icons or emoji (visual markers)
✓ Numbered lists (sequential)
```

**3. Section Breaks**
```
Clear visual separation between sections:
- Background color changes
- Horizontal rules
- Generous padding
- Section headlines
```

**4. The F-Pattern**
```
Readers scan in an F-pattern:
- Across the top (hero headline)
- Down the left side (subheadlines)
- Horizontal again when something catches attention

IMPLICATION:
- Put key info on left
- Use descriptive subheadlines
- Make headlines self-sufficient
```

**5. Highlight Key Takeaways**
```
Use visual emphasis for:
- Specific numbers/results
- Key benefits
- Guarantees
- Social proof stats
```

### 4.4 The Risk Reversal Principle

**Psychological Barrier:**
Every purchase involves risk. The higher the commitment, the higher the perceived risk.

**Your Job:**
Transfer risk from buyer to seller.

**Risk Reversal Techniques:**

**1. Money-Back Guarantee**
```
Weak: "Satisfaction guaranteed"
Strong: "100% money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied after 30 days, we refund everything. No questions asked."

Stronger: "If you don't save at least 5 hours per week within 30 days, we'll refund you 100% AND pay you $50 for wasting your time."
```

**2. Free Trial**
```
Weak: "Try it free"
Strong: "14-day free trial. No credit card required. Full access to everything."

Emphasize: What they can accomplish in trial period
"Build your first AI agent in the trial. Keep it even if you cancel."
```

**3. Conditional Guarantee**
```
"If you complete all 6 weeks and don't land an AI job interview within 90 days, we'll refund your tuition 100%."

(Puts responsibility on participation, but removes risk)
```

**4. Social Proof as Risk Reduction**
```
"Join 10,000 teams" = Safety in numbers
"94% still use us after 12 months" = Low regret rate
"4.9/5 from 1,200 reviews" = Validated by peers
```

**5. Transparent Cancellation**
```
"Cancel anytime. One click. No retention calls. No fees."

(Reduces commitment fear)
```

**Where to Place Risk Reversal:**

```
PRIMARY: Near final CTA
"Start your free trial → No credit card required"

SECONDARY: In FAQ
Q: "What if it doesn't work for me?"
A: "100% money-back guarantee for 30 days..."

TERTIARY: Near pricing
"Try risk-free for 30 days"
```

## Part 5: CTA Strategy

### 5.1 CTA Button Principles

**1. Clarity Over Cleverness**
```
Weak: "Take the leap!"
Strong: "Start Free Trial"
Strongest: "Start 14-Day Free Trial"
```

**2. Benefit-Oriented Language**
```
Generic: "Submit"
Better: "Get Started"
Best: "Get My Free AI Prompts"
```

**3. Specificity Reduces Friction**
```
Vague: "Sign up"
Specific: "Book My Strategy Call"
More Specific: "Book Free 30-Minute Call"
```

**4. Remove Anxiety Words**
```
High Friction: "Buy now" "Purchase" "Submit payment"
Low Friction: "Start trial" "Get access" "Claim spot"
```

**5. First-Person Can Increase Conversion**
```
Third-Person: "Start your trial"
First-Person: "Start my trial"

(Test both—first-person often converts better because it increases commitment)
```

### 5.2 CTA Placement Strategy

**Where to Place CTAs:**

```
MANDATORY:
1. Hero section (above fold)
   → Primary action, high visibility

2. After transformation/outcome section
   → Emotional peak, desire created

3. After social proof section
   → Credibility established

4. End of page (final pitch)
   → Last chance for convinced visitors

OPTIONAL (Test):
5. Sticky header
   → Always available

6. Sticky footer
   → Mobile-friendly always-present option

7. Exit-intent popup
   → Last-ditch effort
```

**CTA Frequency Rule:**
Repeat CTA every 1-2 scroll depths on long pages. Don't make convinced visitors hunt for the button.

### 5.3 Multi-CTA Strategy

**When to Use Multiple CTA Types:**

**Primary CTA:** High commitment (purchase, book call, start trial)
**Secondary CTA:** Lower commitment (download guide, watch demo, see examples)

**Layout Pattern:**
```
[Primary CTA Button - Bold, contrasting]
     or
[Secondary CTA Link - Subtle, text-based]
```

**Example:**
```
[Start Free Trial] ← Primary (button)
     or
Watch 2-minute demo → Secondary (link)
```

**Principle:**
Give conversion-ready visitors the main action, give hesitant visitors an easier next step.

## Part 6: Mobile Optimization Principles

### 6.1 Mobile-Specific Considerations

**Mobile Reality:**
- 60-70% of traffic is mobile
- Smaller screens = less visible content
- Thumb-based navigation
- Often lower intent (browsing vs researching)

**Mobile Landing Page Principles:**

**1. Hero Must Work in Small Screen**
```
Desktop: Headline + Subheadline + CTA + Image (side-by-side)
Mobile: Headline → CTA → Image → Subheadline (vertical stack)

Make sure headline + CTA fit in first screen.
```

**2. Shorter Paragraphs**
```
Desktop: 3-4 sentences per paragraph
Mobile: 2-3 sentences max
```

**3. Larger CTA Buttons**
```
Desktop: Can be smaller, precise clicking
Mobile: Minimum 44x44 pixels (thumb-friendly)
```

**4. Sticky CTAs More Important**
```
Desktop: Easier to scroll and find button
Mobile: Sticky CTA reduces need to scroll back up
```

**5. Collapsible Sections (FAQ)**
```
Desktop: Can show all FAQs open
Mobile: Use accordion (collapse/expand)
```

**6. Click-to-Call**
```
If phone number is CTA option, make it clickable:
<a href="tel:+1234567890">Call Now</a>
```

1. Hero (headline, subheadline, CTA)
2. Problem (if needed)
3. Transformation
4. Process
5. Features/Benefits
6. Social Proof
7. FAQ/Objections
8. Final CTA
```

**Step 4: Apply Principles**
```
Each section:
- One job per section
- Scannable formatting
- Specific over vague
- Proof integrated throughout
```

**Step 5: CTA Strategy**

- Primary CTA in hero
- Repeat after social proof
- Repeat at end
- Consider sticky CTA for mobile
```
