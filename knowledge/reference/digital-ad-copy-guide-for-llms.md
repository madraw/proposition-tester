---

## 3. Core Principles (Billboard Discipline For Digital)

Apply these to all formats: LinkedIn, Meta, Google, Reddit, display.

1. **One idea per asset**
   - Each ad focuses on one value proposition from the 5 being tested
   - Remove side benefits and sub-stories

2. **Clarity beats cleverness**
   - Reader should "get it" in one glance
   - Ban jargon: "agentic AI," "LLMs," "RAG," "fine-tuning"
   - Use: "AI agents," "AI workflows," "AI automation"

3. **Self-interest first**
   - Talk about career outcomes: promotions, job offers, salary, security, credibility
   - Turn "we teach AI" into "you build AI agents that get you promoted"

4. **Destroy the coding barrier explicitly**
   - State "no coding required" or "without writing code"
   - Use real examples: "Build AI agents in 5 minutes, not 5 months"

5. **Be specific, not vague**
   - Use numbers: "6 weeks," "3-4 days," "10+ years experience," "$10k/month opportunity cost"
   - Make transformation believable: "From never using AI to deploying marketing automation"

6. **Short, strong language**
   - Prefer short words and strong verbs (build, launch, lead, transform, master)
   - Avoid weak verbs (enable, leverage, facilitate, optimize)

7. **Contrast and surprise**
   - Use simple contrasts: displaced vs. indispensable, left behind vs. leading, coding vs. building
   - The twist must be **instantly understood**

8. **Brand clarity**
   - Use "InterviewKickstart" or "IK" clearly
   - Leverage credibility: "Trusted by 100+ professionals"

### Quick Do vs Don't Overview

| Focus | Do | Do not |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Coding barrier | "Build AI agents without coding." | "Learn to leverage cutting-edge LLM frameworks." |
| Self-interest | "Get promoted by leading AI projects." | "We teach advanced agentic AI techniques." |
| Specificity | "From zero to AI builder in 6 weeks." | "Comprehensive AI transformation program." |
| Verbs | "Build your first AI agent in week 1." | "Gain comprehensive AI competencies." |
| Audience pain | "Laid off? Get back to work AI-enabled." | "Professional development for AI era." |
| Brand | "InterviewKickstart. AI skills without code." | "AI skills without code." (weak branding) |

## 6. High-Performing Patterns For IK AI Business

Use these patterns as templates. Mix them across platforms while keeping the **same core promise**.

### 6.1 Barrier-removing promise

* **Use when:** Addressing the "need to code" misconception
* **Formula:** `Build [AI outcome] without [barrier].`

Examples:
- "Build AI agents without coding."

### 6.4 Fear-based contrast

* **Use when:** Addressing displacement anxiety
* **Formula:** `[Negative outcome] or [positive outcome]. Your choice.`

Examples:

* **Formula:** `[Specific outcome]. [Proof point or testimonial hook].`

Examples:
- "Build AI agents in week 1. Ask our 100+ graduates."
- "No code. Real AI. Live instruction."

### 6.6 Simple question (misconception destroyer)

* **Use when:** Surfacing hidden barrier
* **Formula:** `Question that reveals misconception.`

Examples:
- "Think you need to code for AI?"
- "Still waiting to learn Python before AI?"
- "Avoided AI because you're not technical?"

### 6.7 Direct command

* **Use when:** Clear next step, confident positioning
* **Formula:** `Verb first + clear career payoff.`

Examples:
- "Build AI agents. Get promoted."

Examples:
- "Monday morning meeting. You present the AI workflow you built."
- "Next interview. Show them your AI portfolio."
- "Your team needs AI leadership. You're ready."

When writing a set of ads, generate **multiple variants per pattern** around the same core value proposition.

## 8. Platform-Specific Best Practices

### LinkedIn
- **Tone:** Professional, outcome-focused, career-transformation

### Reddit
- **Tone:** Authentic, conversational, value-first (not salesy)

- **CTAs:** Soft, educational, "if interested" framing
- **Subreddits:** r/careerguidance, r/marketing, r/entrepreneur, r/ArtificialIntelligence (use cautiously)

Example Reddit post:
```
Title: How I went from laid off marketing manager to building AI agents (without coding)

Body:
Got laid off in August after 12 years in marketing. Spent the first month panicking and sending resumes.

Then I did something different: learned to build AI agents. Not by learning Python or ML theory - by using no-code tools to automate real marketing workflows.

6 weeks later, I had a portfolio of AI projects I'd actually built. In interviews, instead of explaining the gap, I showed them working AI automation I created.

Got 3 offers. Took the one that let me lead their AI transformation.

No coding required. Live instruction with other professionals. Hands-on from day 1.

If you're in a career gap or worried about AI displacement, happy to share what worked.

## 9. Example Transformation For Self-Critique

Use before-and-after thinking when you generate drafts.

### Example 1: Removing Jargon

* **Weak:** "Master agentic AI frameworks and RAG implementations for enterprise LLM deployment."
* **Strong:** "Build AI agents that actually work. No coding required."

Improvements:
- Removed technical jargon (agentic, RAG, LLM)
- Added barrier-removing promise (no coding)
- Simplified to core benefit (build AI agents)

### Example 2: Adding Career Benefit

* **Weak:** "Learn AI tools and techniques in our comprehensive program."
* **Strong:** "From laid off to AI-enabled. 6 weeks. Interview-ready portfolio."

Improvements:
- Specific audience (laid off professionals)
- Concrete timeframe (6 weeks)
- Clear outcome (interview-ready portfolio)
- Emotional resonance (career transformation)

### Example 3: Destroying Barrier Explicitly

* **Weak:** "AI course for business professionals."
* **Strong:** "Build AI agents without coding. Yes, really."

Improvements:
- Addresses #1 barrier directly (coding misconception)
- Adds credibility reinforcement ("Yes, really")
- Stronger verb (build vs learn)

For each ad batch:
1. Draft a line
2. Rewrite it into **two stronger variants** that increase clarity, barrier-removal, and career benefit

---

## 10. Headline Quality Rubric (IK AI Business Specific)

Score key lines (hooks, headlines, hero copy) on 1 to 5. Aim for 4 or 5.

| Criterion | 1 – Weak | 3 – OK | 5 – Excellent |
|-----------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Clarity | Confusing, jargon-heavy | Understandable but slightly technical | Instantly clear to non-technical reader |
| Barrier-removal | Doesn't address coding barrier | Implies no coding needed | Explicitly destroys coding misconception |
| Career benefit | Pure feature description | Implicit career outcome | Clear transformation: promotion, job, credibility |
| Specificity | Vague timeframes and outcomes | Some numbers, somewhat concrete | Specific: 6 weeks, $10k, portfolio, 100+ grads |
| Emotional impact | Flat, no feeling | Mild interest or concern | Strong emotion: fear, urgency, hope, confidence |
| Audience fit | Generic, could be anyone | Roughly targets segment | Speaks directly to specific segment pain |
| Brand voice | Too casual or too corporate | Acceptable professional tone | Confident, empowering, barrier-removing IK voice |

Use the rubric internally to revise: rewrite lines scoring below 4.

## 13. UTM Tracking And Variant Naming

Every ad should have UTM parameters for A/B testing:

**UTM Structure:**
```
?utm_campaign=[value-prop-variant]
&utm_source=[platform]
&utm_medium=cpc
&utm_content=[headline-variant]
&utm_term=[audience-segment]
```

---

## 16. Critical Success Factors

Your ads will succeed when they:

1. **Destroy the coding barrier explicitly** - This is non-negotiable
2. **Speak to specific career pain** - Not generic professional development
3. **Use concrete numbers** - 6 weeks, $1,499, 100+ grads, 3 days
4. **Focus on transformation outcome** - Portfolio, promotion, job, credibility
5. **Sound confident, not desperate** - IK is selective, not sales-heavy
6. **Remove friction** - Book call (not buy now)
7. **Target one segment clearly** - Don't try to speak to everyone
8. **Stay jargon-free** - If a marketer doesn't understand it, rewrite it

Your ads will fail when they:

1. **Assume coding knowledge** or use technical jargon
2. **Talk about features** instead of career outcomes
3. **Sound generic** - Could apply to any online course
4. **Overpromise** - "Become AI expert in 3 days"
5. **Lack specificity** - Vague timeframes, outcomes, or proof
6. **Ignore the barrier** - Don't address coding misconception
7. **Push too hard** - Desperate, hype-filled, fear-mongering
8. **Confuse the audience** - Try to be too clever

---

## 17. Final Checklist: The Billboard Test

Before finalizing any ad, apply the **Billboard Test**:

**Imagine this ad on a highway billboard. A driver has 3 seconds.**

1. Can they understand the **core promise** in one glance?
2. Is it **clear who it's for**?
3. Is the **benefit obvious**?
4. Would they remember the **brand name**?
5. Is there **one clear idea** (not three)?

If any answer is "no," rewrite until all are "yes."

**Example that passes:**
```
Build AI Agents
Without Coding

InterviewKickstart
6 Weeks. Real Skills.
```

**Example that fails:**
```
Comprehensive AI Marketing
Accelerator Program with
Advanced Agentic Workflows,
Custom GPTs, and Make
Automation for Enterprise
Marketing Professionals

InterviewKickstart.com/ai
```

The first is a billboard. The second is a brochure.

**Always write billboards.**
