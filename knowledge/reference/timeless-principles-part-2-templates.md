### Pattern Library 2: Body Copy Structures

**Structure 1: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)**

```
PROBLEM: State the pain point clearly
AGITATE: Make it worse (show consequences)
SOLVE: Present your solution

Example:
P: "Spending 5 hours per week in meetings taking notes?"
A: "That's 260 hours per year. An entire month of your life."
S: "AI meeting notes give you 5 hours back. Every week."
```

**Structure 2: Before-After-Bridge**

```
BEFORE: Current painful state
AFTER: Desired state (with solution)
BRIDGE: How to get there

Example:
BEFORE: "Tired at noon. Can't focus. Third coffee doesn't help."
AFTER: "Alert all day. Focused through 5pm."
BRIDGE: "Switch to Northwind. Twice the caffeine, none of the crash."
```

**Structure 3: Features-Advantages-Benefits (FAB)**

```
FEATURE: What it is
ADVANTAGE: What it does better
BENEFIT: What you get

Example:
F: "AI-powered job matching"
A: "Scans 10,000+ jobs in seconds"
B: "Land interviews 3x faster"
```

**Structure 4: The Reason Why**

```
CLAIM: Make your promise
REASON: Explain why it's true
PROOF: Add evidence

Example:
CLAIM: "You'll write 10x faster"
REASON: "AI handles research and first drafts"
PROOF: "Average user goes from 1 post/week to 10 posts/week"
```

**Structure 5: The Comparison**

```
THEM: What competitors/alternatives offer
YOU: What you offer differently
RESULT: Why yours is better

Example:
THEM: "Most AI courses teach theory"
YOU: "We build real projects from day 1"
RESULT: "You finish with a portfolio, not just knowledge"
```

## Section 5: Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem 1: "Copy feels generic and boring"

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Could this work for any competitor?
- Are there specific numbers, names, or details?
- Does it sound like marketing speak?

**Fixes:**
1. Add specific metrics and timeframes
2. Use customer language (not corporate speak)
3. Include proof points (customer names, numbers)
4. Find your unique angle (what ONLY you can say)

**Example Fix:**
```
Before: "We help businesses grow"
After: "We helped Acme Corp go from $2M to $8M ARR in 14 months"
```

---

### Problem 2: "Too long and wordy"

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Can you say it in one breath?
- Could you cut 30% without losing meaning?
- Are there filler words (really, very, that, actually)?

**Fixes:**
1. Remove setup words and qualifiers
2. Cut adjectives and adverbs
3. Convert passive to active voice
4. Combine or delete redundant phrases

**Example Fix:**
```
Before: "We really help you to actually improve your business operations"
After: "We improve your operations"
Better: "Cut costs 30%"
```

---

### Problem 3: "Not getting clicks/conversions"

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Is the benefit immediately clear?
- Does it trigger an emotion?
- Is there a compelling reason to act NOW?
- Does it differentiate from competitors?

**Fixes:**
1. Lead with outcome, not process
2. Add urgency or scarcity
3. Include social proof
4. Test more specific promises

**Example Fix:**
```
Before: "Try our platform"
After: "Join 2,400 marketers. Free 14-day trial."
```

---

### Problem 4: "Headline not standing out"

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Does it use pattern interrupt?
- Is it more specific than competitors?
- Does it create curiosity?

**Fixes:**
1. Use contrast or surprise
2. Lead with specific number
3. Ask provocative question
4. Make contrarian claim

**Example Fix:**
```
Before: "Better marketing results"
After: "Stop wasting ad spend. This AI finds your buyers."
```

---

### Problem 5: "Sounds too salesy or pushy"

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Are you using hype words (revolutionary, amazing)?
- Is there too much urgency without value?
- Do you sound desperate?

**Fixes:**
1. Replace hype with specificity
2. Add proof before asking
3. Use softer CTAs
4. Lead with value, not pitch

**Example Fix:**
```
Before: "Amazing limited-time opportunity! Buy now!"
After: "50 prompt templates. Free download."
```

---

### Problem 6: "Visual and copy don't work together"

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Does the copy just describe the visual?
- Could the visual work without the copy?
- Do they create 1+1=3 effect?

**Fixes:**
1. Let visual show, copy tells why/what's next
2. Add meaning visual can't convey
3. Create curiosity gap between them
4. Use copy to add specificity to visual

**Example Fix:**
```
Before:
Visual: Coffee cup
Copy: "Hot coffee"

After:
Visual: Coffee cup
Copy: "Eyes open by exit 12"
```

---

### Problem 7: "Wrong tone for platform/audience"

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Does it match platform norms?
- Would your audience talk this way?
- Is formality level appropriate?

**Fixes:**
1. Study top-performing ads on that platform
2. Use language from customer reviews
3. Match platform context (professional vs casual)
4. Test different tone variations

**Example Fix:**
```
LinkedIn: "Land your first AI role in 90 days"
Instagram: "From zero to AI builder in 6 weeks 🚀"

### Problem 8: "Tried to be clever, now it's confusing"

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Does it need explanation?
- Would someone get it in 3 seconds?
- Are you sacrificing clarity for cleverness?

**Fixes:**
1. Default to clear version
2. Test clever vs clear
3. Only use cleverness if INSTANTLY clear
4. Have someone unfamiliar read it

**Example Fix:**
```
Before: "We're brewing innovation in cups of disruption"
After: "Strong coffee for brutal mornings"
```
