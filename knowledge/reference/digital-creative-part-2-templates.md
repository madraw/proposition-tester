**IMAGE:**
- Generic stock photo of diverse people in meeting, smiling
- No text overlay

**COPY:**
- Headline: "Improve your team's productivity"
- Description: "Our software helps teams work better together. Learn more."

**Problems:**
- Generic stock photo (low trust)
- Vague benefit ("improve productivity")
- No specificity (who, how much, how fast)
- Weak CTA ("Learn more")

**Rubric Score: 8/25**
- Scroll-stop: 1/5 (invisible in feed)
- Clarity: 2/5 (vague message)
- Partnership: 1/5 (image adds nothing)
- Platform fit: 2/5 (too generic for LinkedIn)
- CTA: 2/5 (weak, no benefit)

---

#### AFTER (Strong)

**IMAGE:**
- Clean dashboard screenshot
- Key metrics highlighted (green boxes)
- Text overlay: "See Who's Stuck" (large, bold)
- 40% negative space (white background)

**COPY:**

---

#### AFTER (Strong - Reddit-Appropriate)

**IMAGE:**
- Actual screenshot of product (rough, real)
- Showing specific feature
- No stock imagery

**TITLE:**
"I got tired of Notion's loading times, so I built this (honest review after 3 months)"

**BODY:**
"Hey r/productivity - I know promoted posts are annoying, so I'll be quick.

I built this tool because Notion kept freezing when my databases got big. Been using it daily for 3 months now.

**What's good:**
- Loads instantly (even with 10k+ items)
- Offline-first (works on planes)
- Free tier is actually useful

**What's not:**
- No mobile app yet (working on it)
- Learning curve if you're used to Notion's blocks

**Who it's for:**
If you have huge databases and Notion is slow, this might help. If you just take notes, Notion is probably fine.

Link in comments. Happy to answer questions. Not trying to hard-sell, just sharing in case it helps anyone."

**PINNED COMMENT:**
"Link: [url]
Also, I'm in this thread for the next hour if anyone wants to roast my UI design (it's not great yet, I know)."

**Improvements:**
- Honest, self-aware tone
- Acknowledges it's an ad
- Real screenshot (not polished)
- Admits weaknesses
- Conversational, not corporate
- Value-first (helping, not selling)

**Why it works:**
- Feels authentic
- Respects community norms
- Provides actual information
- Not overly promotional
- Invites genuine discussion

**Expected CTR:** 0.5-1%

---

#### AFTER (Strong)

**THUMBNAIL:**

- Text: "...and doubled my income" (bottom, smaller)
- Bright yellow background
- High contrast

**HEADLINE:** "Why I quit my $120k job (and why you shouldn't)"

**Improvements:**
- Curiosity gap (quit but telling you not to?)
- Specific number ($120k)
- Strong emotion (shocked face)
- High contrast colors
- Counter-intuitive headline

**Expected CTR:** 3-5%

**Why it works:**
- Pattern interrupt (yellow pops in feed)

### 10.3 Post-Launch Performance Audit

**After 3-7 days of running, check:**

**Delivery:**

- [ ] Frequency under 3 (not showing same people too often)
- [ ] Impressions match expectations

**Engagement:**
- [ ] CTR above platform benchmark
  - LinkedIn: 0.5%+ (good), 1%+ (great)
  - Meta: 1%+ (good), 2%+ (great)
  - Google Display: 0.1%+ (good), 0.5%+ (great)

- [ ] Video view-through rate (if video) above 25%

**Conversion:**

- [ ] CPA within budget
- [ ] Quality of leads/customers acceptable

**Creative Diagnosis:**

**If low impressions:**
- Check targeting (too narrow?)
- Check budget (too low?)
- Check bid (too low?)

**If low CTR:**
- Test new headline (biggest lever)
- Test new image (second biggest lever)
- Check platform fit (wrong tone?)

**If low conversion rate:**
- Check landing page (mismatched message?)
- Check offer (not compelling?)
- Check CTA (weak or unclear?)

**If high CTR but low conversion:**
- Headline/image overpromised
- Landing page experience poor
- Offer not aligned with ad

**If low engagement but high CTR:**
